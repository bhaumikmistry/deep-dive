A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the element are not stored at contigous memory locations. The elements in the linked list are linked using pointers.

A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and reference to the next node in the list.

Linked list is a linear data structure, Unlike arrays, linked list elemets are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

#### Disadvantage of contiguous arrays
+ The size of the array is fixed. The allocated memory is equal to the upper limt irrespective of the usage.
+ Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.

#### Advantages over arrays 
+ Dynamic size
+ Ease of Insertion/deletion
