# Data Structure

> Data structures are the way we are able to store and retirve data. The data structures that exist in programming languages are pretty similar to real-world systems that we use outside of the digital sphere. Imagine that you go to the grocery store.

# How are data structure used?
Data structures handle foru main fucntions for us:
+ Inputting Information
+ Processing Information 
+ Maintaining informatoin 
+ Retriving information 

## The Five requirements of any data structure
+ How to ```Access```
+ How to ```Insert```
+ How to ```Delete```
+ How to ```Find```
+ How to ```Sort```

## Choosing the best data structure
___
Different dta structures are better suited for different tasks. Choosing the wrong data structure can result in slow or unresponsive code (and mess up your program!) So it's important to consider a few factors as you make your decision.

1. What is the intended purpose of the data? Do any data structures have buil-in functionality that is ideally suited for this purpose? Do you want to search, sort, or iterate data in a way which certain data structures would be better suited than others?
2. Do you want or need control over how memory is set aside to store your data?
    + Data structures that use static memory allocation ( e.g stacks or arrays) will manage memory for you and assume a fixed amount of memory uppon instantiation with a cap on how much data may be added.
    + Data structures that utilze dynamic memory allocation (e.g heaps or linked lists) allow you to allocate and reallocate memory within the life of the program.
3. How long will it take different data structures to accomplish various tasks relative to other data structres?
