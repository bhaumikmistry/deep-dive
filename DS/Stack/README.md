# Stack

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO or FILO.

+ `push` Adds an item in the stack. if the stack is full, then it is said to be an overflow condition.
+ `Pop` Removes as item from the stack. The irems are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an underflow condition.
+ `Peek or Top` Returns top element of stack.
+ `isEmpty` Resturns true if the stack is empty.
